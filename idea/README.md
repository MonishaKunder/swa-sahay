<h2>Inspiration</h2>
In rural areas 10-25 womens form self-helping groups called swa-sahaya.
In these groups, members save small amount of money in regular basis. Members who have financial requirement can take loan from this collected money.
Interest rates for these loan will be very low compared to any financial institution. All these savings and loans details are maintained in books. So I would like to digitalize this.

<h2>What it does</h2>
<b>Swa-sahay</b> is a hybird mobile application to keep track of saving and loans in self-helping group. Admin user can create group and add memebers.<br/> 
<b>Admin functionalities:</b>

* Create Group
* Add members to Group
* Set settings like 
    - weekly, quaterly or monthly savings
    - loan interest rates
* Add records to capture saving members
* Add loan payment record

<b>Member functionalities:</b>
For members it is not mandatory to have app. If member has app then members can view the following:
* View all the groups which they are part-of.
* In each group they can view their total saving amount, outstanding loan amount and next loan premium to pay.
* Get reminders for meeting.
